#### By _Paul LeTourneau_

#### _An application that allows a pastry shop owner, Pierre, to keep track of his Vendors and Orders._

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET 6
* MSTest

## Description

The application allows Pierre to make basic Vendor profiles and track orders (which hold prices, which vendor made the order, a date, and a description of the order).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository from GitHub and open project in a code editor. 
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "PierreDeux". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
